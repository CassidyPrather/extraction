//! Procedural sound effects, as WAV bytes.
//!
//! Every voice is generated at startup, so the toy ships no audio assets: the
//! wasm carries the few hundred bytes of arithmetic below instead of a few
//! hundred kilobytes of samples, and there is nothing to credit in
//! `CREDITS.md`. Swap in `load_sound("thump.wav")` the moment you have real
//! sound design; this exists so the template has something to play.
//!
//! Two constraints shape what is here. macroquad's audio API offers volume
//! and looping and nothing else — no pitch control — so anything that should
//! vary by pitch is baked into its own buffer, and only gain varies at
//! runtime. And on the web these bytes go through the browser's
//! `decodeAudioData`, which never reports failure back to us in a form
//! macroquad surfaces, so a malformed header hangs the loader instead of
//! erroring. The tests at the bottom guard the header for that reason.
